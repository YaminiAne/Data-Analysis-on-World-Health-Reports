# Data-Analysis-on-World-Health-Reports

## (1) Introduction
What matters most to us? Is it making a lot of money, having a perfect body, or being the center of attention? Judging by the recent World Happiness Report, it seems 
that achieving happiness is now a top global priority. The World Happiness Report ranks countries based on how happy their citizens are. The report's authors used a 
survey questionnaire to measure six factors that contribute to happiness: positive emotions, mental health, life satisfaction, positive social interactions, physical 
health and happiness at work. According to the World Happiness Report, focusing on our material possessions isnâ€™t what leads to lasting happiness. In fact, the report
shows that having highly positive mental and social relationships is one of the key factors in keeping us happy especially after the pandemic.

This project is an analysis of the World Happiness Report during the pandemic that is from 2020 to 2021 and also see how it has changed in 2022. We analyse and look 
into the details of how the happiness indicators have changed through the pandemic and affected the country rankings on the basis of citizen happiness levels.

## (2) Dataset
The dataset that we use is taken from kaggle. You can find the link of the dataset here:

World Happiness report is a survey that rates nations according on how content and happy their residents think they are. More than 150 countries are ranked in the World Happiness Report. Using quantitative measurements, the paper analyses six qualitative characteristics to determine how they affect a country's population's degree of happiness. Here are the six indicators:

- GDP per capita of the nation
- Healthy life expectancy
- Social support
- Freedom to make life choices
- Generosity
- Perceptions of corruption
There is another factor called dystopia residual which means the comparison with the worst possible life in all aspects.

Information from the Gallup World Poll is used to calculate the happiness ratings and rankings. Based on responses to the primary life evaluation question in the survey, the results are calculated. The Cantril ladder is a question that asks respondents to rank their present lives on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best conceivable life for them and 0 being the worst possible existence. The estimates are representative due to the use of Gallup weights and scores from national sample for the years 2020-2022.

These factors are thought to be raising life assessments around the globe. The best life is represented by a number closer to 10, while the opposite case is indicated by a score closer to 0.
